Python - Almost a circle
The objects of this project are:

How to serialize and deserialize a Class
What is Unit testing and how to implement it in a large project
How to write and read a JSON file
What is *args and how to use it
What is **kwargs and how to use it
How to handle named arguments in a function
1. Create a Base Class
Base class:

private class attribute __nb_objects = 0
class constructor: def __init__(self, id=None)
2. Create Retangle Class
Rectangle class: inherits from Base

Private instance attributes with its own getter and setter:
width
height
x
y
Class constructor: def __init__(self, width, height, x=0, y=0, id=None)
3. Validate Attributes
Updates [Rectangle] class by validating it attributes:

width and height must be integers and greater than 0
x and y must be integer and greater than or equal to 0
Raise TypeError if type not integer and ValueError if wrong value are given
4. Calculate Area
Defines a method def area(self) to calculate area from width and height

5. Display 2D Structure of Instance
Adds def display(self) method

Prints 2D representation of Rectangle instance to the stdout
The Structure should be drawn with #
6. String Representation
Override the __str__ method to return string representation in the following format:

[Rectangle] (<id>) <x>/<y> - <width>/<height>
7. Updates 2D Display
Updates the def display(self) method to factor x and y attributes

x: The number of spaces characters before display
y: The nuumber of \n characters to print before display
8. Create an Update Method
Adds a public method def update(self, *args) to modify instance attributes

args is a tuple of variable positional arguments
1st argument is id
2nd argument is width
3rd argument is height
4th argument is x
5th argument is y
9. Improve Update Method
Updates the update method to accept keyword arguments def update(self, *args, **kwargs)

**kwargs is variable amount of key=value arguments
**kwargs must be skipped if args exist and is not empty
Each key in this dictionary represents an attribute to the instance
10. Square Class
Creates a Square class that inherits from Rectangle

Class constructor: def __init__(self, size, x=0, y=0, id=None)
Call the super class with id, x, y, width and height - this super call will use the logic of the __init__ of the Rectangle class.
All width, height, x and y validation must inherit from Rectangle - same behavior in case of wrong data
The overloading __str__ method should return [Square] (<id>) <x>/<y> - <size> - in our case, width or height
11. Square size
Adds a Getter and Setter to Square size

The setter should assign (in this order) the width and the height - with the same value
The setter should have the same value validation as the Rectangle for width and height - No need to change the exception error message (It should be the one from width)
12. Square Update
Update the class Square by adding the public method def update(self, *args, **kwargs)

*args is the list of arguments - no-keyworded arguments
1st argument is id
2nd argument is size
3rd argument is x
4th argument is y
**kwargs can be thought of as a double pointer to a dictionary: key/value (keyworded arguments)
**kwargs must be skipped if *args exists and is not empty
13. Rectangle instance to dictionary representation
Update the class Rectangle by adding the public method def to_dictionary(self)

returns the dictionary representation of a Rectangle
dictionary must contain:
id
width
height
x
y
14. Square instance to dictionary representation
Update the class Square by adding the public method def to_dictionary(self)

returns the dictionary representation of a Square
dictionary must contain:
id
size
x
y
15. Dictionary to JSON string
Update the class Base by adding the static method def to_json_string(list_dictionaries)

returns the JSON string representation of list_dictionaries
list_dictionaries is a list of dictionaries
If list_dictionaries is None or empty, return the string: "[]"
Otherwise, return the JSON string representation of list_dictionaries
16. JSON string to file
Update the class Base by adding the class method def save_to_file(cls, list_objs)

writes the JSON string representation of list_objs to a file
list_objs is a list of instances who inherits of Base - example: list of Rectangle or list of Square instances
If list_objs is None, save an empty list
The filename must be: <Class name>.json - example: Rectangle.json
Must use the static method to_json_string (created before)
Must overwrite the file if it already exists
17. JSON string to dictionary
Update the class Base by adding the static method def from_json_string(json_string)

returns the list of the JSON string representation json_string
json_string is a string representing a list of dictionaries
If json_string is None or empty, return an empty list
Otherwise, return the list represented by json_string
18. Dictionary to Instance
Update the class Base by adding the class method def create(cls, **dictionary)

returns an instance with all attributes already set
**dictionary can be thought of as a double pointer to a dictionary
To use the update method to assign all attributes, you must create a “dummy” instance before
Create a Rectangle or Square instance with “dummy” mandatory attributes (width, height, size, etc.)
Call update instance method to this “dummy” instance to apply your real values
Must use the method def update(self, *args, **kwargs)
**dictionary must be used as **kwargs of the method update
You are not allowed to use eval
19. File to instances
Update the class Base by adding the class method def load_from_file(cls) returns a list of instances:
The filename must be: <Class name>.json - example: Rectangle.json
If the file doesn’t exist, return an empty list
Otherwise, return a list of instances - the type of these instances depends on cls (current class using this method)
Must use the from_json_string and create methods (implemented previously)
20. JSON ok, but CSV?
Update the class Base by adding the class methods def save_to_file_csv(cls, list_objs): and def load_from_file_csv(cls) that serializes and deserializes in CSV

The filename must be: <Class name>.csv - example: Rectangle.csv
Has the same behavior as the JSON serialization/deserialization
Format of the CSV
Rectangle: <id>,<width>,<height>,<x>,<y>
Square: <id>,<size>,<x>,<y>
21. Let's draw it
Update the class Base by adding the static method def draw(list_rectangles, list_squares): that opens a window and draws all the Rectangles and Squares:

Must use the Turtle graphics module
To install it: sudo apt-get install python3-tk
No constraints for color, shape etc… be creative!
